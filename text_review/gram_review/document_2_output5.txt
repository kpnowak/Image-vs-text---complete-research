### Sentence 5:
**Original Sentence:**
"It is not for those with liver problems."

**Deviation from the guidelines originally provided by the expert reviewer:**
The expert reviewer's correction "It is not intended for those with liver problems." does not sufficiently improve the formality of the sentence, and an explicit causality could improve clarity.

**Expert Reviewer's Original Suggested Change:**
"It is not intended for those with liver problems."

**Reason for the reason behind your new suggested change:**
The phrasing "not intended for" introduces formality, but specifying that it is due to potential adverse effects provides clearer medical advice and additional clarity.

**New Suggested Sentence:**
"It is not intended for those with liver problems due to potential adverse effects."

### Sentence 9:
**Original Sentence:**
"Tell your doctor if you have diabetes."

**Deviation from the guidelines originally provided by the expert reviewer:**
The expert reviewer's revision "Inform your doctor if you have diabetes, as elevated blood sugar levels have been reported with statins, including CholeCap." is good, but the additional information about the medication could be introduced in a separate sentence for better readability.

**Expert Reviewer's Original Suggested Change:**
"Inform your doctor if you have diabetes, as elevated blood sugar levels have been reported with statins, including CholeCap."

**Reason for the reason behind your new suggested change:**
Combining the instructions with an explanation for the doctor’s advice can make the sentence overly complex. Separating them enhances clarity and readability.

**New Suggested Sentence:**
"Inform your doctor if you have diabetes. Elevated blood sugar levels have been reported with statins, including CholeCap."

How to talk about treatment options

When you're living with type 2 diabetes, it's common to reevaluate and change your treatment to adjust to your changing personal health needs.1

It's important that you feel empowered and ready to talk to your doctor whenever you feel a change could be beneficial. It can be difficult to start these conversations, but with your treatment goals in mind—and by educating yourself more about type 2 diabetes (like you’re doing right now!)—you’ll be able to communicate with your doctor more openly about treatment.

Your doctor is the medical expert, but you are the one living with type 2 diabetes. You know your mind and body, and it’s important to advocate for your needs and preferences during your discussion. Come to every appointment prepared to talk, ask questions and find solutions together. Here are some topics to consider if you want to speak up about your type 2 diabetes treatment:

Goals
Share your personal goals, whether, for example, it’s better blood sugar control or weight management, and discuss with your doctor if your current treatment could be more effective.

Challenges
Discuss any difficulties you’ve experienced with your current treatment - such as side effects, if you would prefer a pill or an injection (if the option is available), if it fits into your lifestyle, or if the cost is too high. If relevant, you can also ask if there might be a better alternative that addresses these challenges.

Lifestyle
Talk about your lifestyle, how it impacts how well your treatment is working, and if changes to your treatment plan are needed. For example, you could be travelling a lot for work and want to make sure your medication is easy to take, or you may need more support with your weight management goals despite already eating healthily and exercising to the best of your ability.

Concerns and side effects
Ask questions or share concerns you may have about your treatment plan. This can mean talking through and understanding how your medication works, what happens if you miss a dose, any side effects you could experience and how to manage them, or any other concerns you may have about the lifestyle changes recommendation to you. Your doctor should be able to talk you through all of those concerns and more. 

Treatment expectations
Set realistic expectations with your doctor regarding the timeline and outcomes of your treatment plan. Understanding what to expect can help you stay motivated and evaluate if any changes you have made to your treatment plan is working. 

Follow-up
If you are making any changes to your treatment plan, discuss with your doctor how you should follow-up on how it is working. Typically, type 2 diabetes patients should see their doctor every 3-6 months to check in and re-evaluate their treatments.

Remember, this conversation is about working together with your doctor to find the best treatment option for you. By speaking up, asking questions and being part of the decision-making process, you can create a personalized plan that could empower you on your journey towards better health.

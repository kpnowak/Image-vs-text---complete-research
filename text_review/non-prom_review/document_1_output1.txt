To review the document according to the "Non-Promotional Material Guidelines", I will meticulously evaluate each section of the provided document and make necessary adjustments to ensure compliance. Below are the corrections needed:

#### Source Sentence:
"It's important that you feel empowered and ready to talk to your doctor whenever you feel a change could be beneficial."

#### Guideline Source:
Communicate With Care Pocket Guide - Article 2 - Be Clear and Professional

#### Deviations:
- The phrase "feel empowered and ready" is somewhat vague and subjective.
- "important to advocate for your needs and preferences" can put undue pressure on the patient instead of promoting a collaborative approach, which might be misinterpreted.

#### New Sentence:
"It’s essential to discuss with your doctor when you think a change in treatment might be appropriate."

#### Reason:
This revision maintains a neutral tone, emphasizing communication without suggesting a strong directive. This approach aligns with maintaining a professional tone and avoiding language that may cause unnecessary pressure on the patient.

### 2. Patient's Role:

#### Source Sentence:
"You know your mind and body, and it’s important to advocate for your needs and preferences during your discussion."

Changing the wording to "share this knowledge openly" encourages communication and collaboration without implying an advocacy role that might feel burdensome to patients.

Thank you for submitting the document for review. I have studied the "Non-Promotional Material Guidelines" and will provide detailed feedback on each sentence from your document that requires amendments. Each point will be corrected based on compliance with the provided guidelines.

### Corrections and Recommendations:

#### 1. "The first and only statin approved for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia in teenagers with familial hypercholesterolaemia¹"
- **Guideline source**: Global Legal & Compliance Pocket Guide
- **Source sentence**: "The first and only statin approved for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia in teenagers with familial hypercholesterolaemia¹"
- **Deviations**: According to the Global Legal & Compliance Pocket Guide, the information must be factual and not promotional. The claim "The first and only statin" could be seen as a promotional statement.
- **New sentence**: "CholeCap is a statin approved for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia in teenagers with familial hypercholesterolaemia¹."
- **Reason for change**: This sentence removes the promotional wording "first and only," making it more factual and in accordance with non-promotional guidelines.

#### 2. "Clinically proven efficacy and safety in paediatric patients²"
- **Guideline source**: EFPIA Chapter 3, Article 16
- **Source sentence**: "Clinically proven efficacy and safety in paediatric patients²"

- **Reason for change**: This change avoids the term "clinically proven," which may sound promotional, maintaining a neutral tone consistent with non-promotional guidelines.

#### 3. "Reduction in LDL-C²"
- **Guideline source**: EFPIA Chapter 4, Article 21
- **Source sentence**: "Reduction in LDL-C²"
- **Deviations**: This is vague and could be seen as an inherent claim without specific context. According to EFPIA Chapter 4, all interactions must ensure clarity.

- **Reason for change**: Adding "studies show" provides context and aligns the statement with clear, non-promotional guidelines.

#### 4. "Dolor sit amet"

- **Source sentence**: "Dolor sit amet"
- **Deviations**: This placeholder text does not provide any information and could confuse readers. According to Article 2, content must be clear and professional.
- **New sentence**: Remove the sentence entirely.
- **Reason for change**: This placeholder text does not contribute any meaningful information and should be removed for clarity and professionalism.

- **New sentence**: "CholeCap has been shown to reduce total cholesterol, LDL-C, and apo B levels in boys and postmenarchal girls, aged 10 to 17, with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia.¹"

- **New sentence**: "Studies indicate that CholeCap may help reduce the risk of heart-related events such as heart attack, stroke, certain cardiac surgeries, and chest pain."
- **Reason for change**: The new sentence removes promotional language and provides a factual basis, improving compliance with non-promotional guidelines.

1. **Original Source Sentence:** "The first and only statin approved for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia in teenagers with familial hypercholesterolaemia."

   **Deviation from Guidelines:** According to the [Source - Global Legal & Compliance Pocket Guide Article 1 - ii], dissemination of factual information about unapproved products or new clinical data must avoid promotional intent. Phrasing the product as "the first and only" tends to introduce a promotional perspective.

   **Expert Reviewer's Original Suggested Change:** "CholeCap is approved for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia in teenagers with familial hypercholesterolaemia, noting its novel approval status."

   **Reason for New Suggested Change:** While the expert's suggestion is a vast improvement, indicating "novel approval status" still leans towards being promotional. Therefore, I suggest a more neutral and factual statement.

   **New Suggested Sentence:** "CholeCap is approved for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia in teenagers with familial hypercholesterolaemia."

2. **Original Source Sentence:** "Clinically proven efficacy and safety in paediatric patients."

   **Deviation from Guidelines:** According to [Source - Disclaimer Texts for Non-promotional Material Article 3 - i, ii, iii], patient-related information should include disclaimers to avoid implying aside from factual data that might hint indirectly at promotion without clarifying the source.

   **Expert Reviewer's Original Suggested Change:** "Disclaimer: The information provided is based on scientific studies and is intended for healthcare professionals. The image shown is a model and not a real patient."

   **Reason for New Suggested Change:** The expert's suggested disclaimer is good, but it can be further improved by ensuring clarity that the efficacy and safety have to be backed by specific studies and sources, enhancing transparency.

   **New Suggested Sentence:** "Disclaimer: The information provided is based on clinical studies reported in scientific literature and is intended for healthcare professionals. The image shown is a model and not a real patient."

3. **Original Source Sentence:** "CholeCap significantly reduces elevated total cholesterol, LDL-C and apo B levels in boys and postmenarchal girls, 10 to 17 years of age, with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia."

   **Deviation from Guidelines:** According to [Source - EFPIA Chapter 3 Article 17 - ii], the information should maintain objectivity and not pitch superiority overtly that may indirectly reflect promotional intent.

   **Expert Reviewer's Original Suggested Change:** "CholeCap may contribute to reducing elevated total cholesterol, LDL-C, and apo B levels in boys and postmenarchal girls, 10 to 17 years old, with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia."

   **Reason for New Suggested Change:** The expert's change is effective but lacks specificity about studies backing the claim. Adding context about the evidence can make the statement more educational.

   **New Suggested Sentence:** "Clinical studies suggest that CholeCap may help reduce elevated total cholesterol, LDL-C, and apo B levels in boys and postmenarchal girls, 10 to 17 years old, with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia."

4. **Original Source Sentence:** "Welcome to a brighter future for your patients."

   **Deviation from Guidelines:** According to [Source - Communicate With Care Pocket Guide Article 2 - i, ii, iii], communication should strictly avoid speculative language and maintain a fact-based, professional tone.

   **Expert Reviewer's Original Suggested Change:** "These patient outcomes are based on clinical trials and scientific evidence."

   **Reason for New Suggested Change:** The expert's suggestion refrains from speculative language, which is good, but it can be enhanced by explicitly stating the source of the evidence to emphasize the factual base.

   **New Suggested Sentence:** "The outcomes observed in patients are based on data from clinical trials and supported by scientific research."

These new suggestions align closely with the guidelines while ensuring the communication remains educational without veering into promotional territory.

Upon reviewing the expert comments against the provided image of the document, I have verified that the original sentences are grammatically correct and follow the "Grammar & Spelling Guidelines." Consequently, no changes apart from one specific correction are necessary. Here is my review for a new suggested change:

### Original Sentence:
"Share your personal goals, whether, for example, it’s better blood sugar control or weight management, and discuss with your doctor if your current treatment could be more effective."

### Deviation from Guidelines Originally Provided by the Expert Reviewer:
- The expert noted no deviations or necessary corrections.

### Expert Reviewer's Original Suggested Change:
- No change suggested as the original sentence is deemed correct.

### Explanation for the New Suggested Change:
- The use of "whether, for example, it’s" is clumsy. It's clearer and more natural to revise this phrase to remove redundancy. The phrase "whether it’s" or "such as" are neater alternatives.

### New Suggested Sentence:
"Share your personal goals, such as better blood sugar control or weight management, and discuss with your doctor if your current treatment could be more effective."

This proposed change aligns better with the guidelines for sentence clarity and readability, ensuring the text is easy to understand without altering the original meaning.

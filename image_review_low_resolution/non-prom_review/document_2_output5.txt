Based on the provided guidelines for non-promotional materials, I have reviewed the image and identified several deviations. Here are the necessary corrections:

### Correction 1
- **Guideline Source**: Disclaimer Texts for Non-promotional Material
- **Source Sentence**: "CholeCap significantly reduces elevated total cholesterol, LDL-C and apo B levels in boys and postmenarchal girls, 10 to 17 years of age, with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia."
- **Deviations**: The promotional nature of the sentence does not align with the non-promotional guidelines. The material should avoid making definitive claims of effectiveness to prevent it from being viewed as promotional.
  - **According to**: "Article 1 - General Disclaimers include in all pages: The image shown is a model and not a real patient."
- **New Sentence**: "CholeCap has been shown in clinical studies to reduce markers related to cholesterol in certain age groups. Consult medical literature for detailed study outcomes."
- **Reason for Replacement**: This ensures the information is presented factually and allows healthcare professionals to seek further information without making promotional claims.

### Correction 2
- **Guideline Source**: Communicate With Care Pocket Guide
- **Source Sentence**: "Clinically proven efficacy and safety in paediatric patients."
- **Deviations**: Phrases like “clinically proven” suggest absolute certainty, which can be misleading.
  - **According to**: "Article 2 - Be Clear and Professional: Stick to Facts: Avoid exaggerations and speculations."
- **New Sentence**: "Based on clinical studies, CholeCap appears to have a profile of efficacy and safety in paediatric patients."
- **Reason for Replacement**: This provides a balanced view of clinical data without overstating the results.

### Correction 3
- **Guideline Source**: EFPIA Chapter 3 Article 17
- **Source Sentence**: "The first and only statin approved for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in teenagers with familial hypercholesterolemia."
- **Deviations**: Using phrases like “first and only” can be overly promotional.
  - **According to**: "i. The provision of Informational or Educational Materials is permitted provided it is: (a) “inexpensive”; (b) directly relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy; and (c) directly beneficial to the care of patients."
- **New Sentence**: "A statin that has been approved for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in teenagers with familial hypercholesterolemia."
- **Reason for Replacement**: This maintains informative content without implying superiority, aligning with non-promotional standards.

### Correction 4
- **Guideline Source**: Disclaimer Texts for Non-promotional Material
- **Source Sentence**: "Welcome to a brighter future for your patients."
- **Deviations**: This sentence is promotional and emotional, which may not be suitable for non-promotional materials.
  - **According to**: "The character and its description are for representation purposes only and does not reflect real patient."
- **New Sentence**: "Consult healthcare providers for comprehensive treatment options suitable for patient needs."
- **Reason for Replacement**: It maintains a factual tone and directs healthcare providers to make informed decisions.

### Correction 5
- **Guideline Source**: Global Legal & Compliance Pocket Guide Semaglutide portfolio Appropriate product communication
- **Source Sentence**: "Reduction in LDL-C"
- **Deviations**: Including a graphic with "Reduction in LDL-C" could be perceived as promotional.
  - **According to**: "Scientific Information Exchange: Sharing of scientific information about products is allowed to keep the medical community informed about new developments and product safety."
- **New Sentence**: "Observations on LDL-C levels in clinical studies"
- **Reason for Replacement**: This states the content in a way that indicates data sharing rather than promotion.

### Correction 6
- **Guideline Source**: Communicate With Care Pocket Guide
- **Source Sentence**: "49% Reduction in LDL-C at week 24 compared to baseline."
- **Deviations**: This statistic is conveyed as an absolute benefit, thereby making it more promotional.
  - **According to**: "Maintain Professional Tone: Use polite language, avoid sarcasm and humor."
- **New Sentence**: "Clinical studies indicate a 49% reduction in LDL-C at week 24 in comparison to baseline levels."
- **Reason for Replacement**: This provides the same information in a clinical tone suitable for scientific communication.

By making these corrections, the reviewed document will adhere to the Non-Promotional Material Guidelines and ensure it provides balanced, factual information without veering into promotional content.
